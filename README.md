## A. Creator Database & Outreach Management

      <em>Structured creator tracking system to monitor outreach and deal status</em>

      <img src="image\chatlog_creator.png" width="100%"><br>
      <em>Direct outreach and deal confirmation with creators via Affiliate Center</em>

This system enabled efficient handling of nano, micro, and macro creators while minimizing missed follow-ups and ensuring campaign readiness.
